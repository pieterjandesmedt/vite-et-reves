We're a **family of five** traveling around the world in a Catana 401 named **Vite & Rêves**.
You can translate this name as Fast & Dreams, but it's also pronounced the same way as 'Vis tes rêves' --- _Live your dreams_.

	{{< portrait src="IMG_5875.jpg" alt="Pieter Jan" >}}
	{{< textcolumn "Pieter Jan came up with this crazy idea of sailing around the world after reading too many travel stories. He started sailing in a [Roga Estel](https://www.google.com/search?q=Roga+Estel&tbm=isch) when he was 12. After a hiatus of a few years, his old love for sailing was reignited when he went on a sailing trip to Sardinia with friends from college. Things got a bit out of hand after that.<br/><br/>After restoring and sailing Gib'Sea 28 [Piece Of Cake](https://sailing.digitalcomet.be) for a few years, he was able to convince Barbara that it wasn't such a crazy idea after all. In an unlikely series of events, they found Vite & Rêves at the perfect time to start their world tour." >}}

	{{< portrait src="IMG_6814.jpg" alt="Barbara" >}}
	{{< textcolumn "Barbara was initially very skeptical about this 'Let's put ourselves and our kids in extreme danger for a year' idea --- and that's putting it mildly. But after a lot of [steady erosion](https://www.amazon.com/GET-HER-BOARD-Nick-OKelly/dp/0578057298) of the initial defenses, she started to see the bright side of it: healthy air, the experience for the kids, bonding as a family, not to mention cocktails on tropical islands. Glossy palm beach brochures may or may not have been involved in the convincing process. In the end, she became a big evangelist about the project, patiently answering the thousands of questions our friends and family had." >}}
</div>

<div class="columns portrait is-multiline">
	{{< portrait src="IMG_6991.jpg" alt="Andreas" >}}
	<div class="column">Andreas is our eldest son. 9 years old, endlessly inquisitive, will take nothing at face value, a joker and a storyteller, likes to learn and show off his knowledge. Keeps us on our toes and makes sure we triple-check our explanations, because he will catch any logical error.</div>
</div>

<div class="columns portrait is-multiline">
	{{< portrait src="IMG_6855_1.jpg" alt="Helder" >}}
	<div class="column">Helder is the middle kid. 6 years old. Kind, helpful, very empathic, thoughtful, almost always happy and content whatever happens, a born diplomat and peacemaker. He might be a reincarnation of the Buddha.</div>
</div>

<div class="columns portrait is-multiline">
	{{< portrait src="IMG_6850.jpg" alt="Mira" >}}
	<div class="column">Mira is our youngest. 4 years old. Fiery, loud, smart, funny, with a great imagination. Will probably try to startle you or throw one of her cuddly toys at you when you set foot on the boat. Catch this, new friend!</div>
