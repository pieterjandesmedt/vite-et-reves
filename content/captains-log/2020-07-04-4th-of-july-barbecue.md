`At: Hog Island`

For the 4th of July, we went to a hidden beach --- Camp Q --- on Hog Island. For the Americans amongst us, it was a bittersweet day though. In Megan's words:

> _I’m struggling this 4th of July, celebrating America. I so dearly miss my friends and my family there, especially in times of need, and wish I could get back there, but at the same time, I’m grateful to be here, in Grenada. I’m grateful to not be witnessing firsthand what’s going on there --- but I also recognize that that means I’m not part of a solution. I’m surrounded by amazing people here from all over the world --- and the general consensus on America from others is not favorable. I don’t blame them; I can’t argue with them._

We didn't let the shituation in the US get us down too much and enjoyed a relaxing day on the beach in the most American way possible: Beer and Burgers. Though we had plenty of delicious health food too!
