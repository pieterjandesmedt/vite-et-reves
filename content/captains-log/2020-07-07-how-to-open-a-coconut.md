`At: Hog Island, Grenada`

When you buy a coconut at a stall, the vendor usually pulls out a huge machete and [goes to town on the coconut](/captains-log/2020-02-23-charlotteville#machete-time), until it has a hole in it and you can drink the coconut water with a straw. It looks impressive and daunting, not something you'd want to try on your boat without years of samurai training.

Luckily, there's a way to enjoy the coconut without the associated machete-wielding madness. Shout out to Alistair for teaching me!

#### Step 1: Cut some 'spoons' from the sides of the coconut

It's best to use a serrated bread knife, as this cuts the fibers easily, but even a Swiss army knife works.

#### Step 2: Cut off the top of the coconut

#### Step 3: Make a hole in the top

This hole frees the healthy and delicious coconut water inside.

#### Step 4: Drink the coconut water

You can use a straw, but those are bad for the environment, so we use a glass. Call us old-fashioned.

#### Step 5: Cut a V and open the coconut

Cut a big V from top to bottom. It gives you a good grip to break open the coconut. Go full caveman and all bystanders will admire your strength when you pull the coconut apart with your bare hands. Hint: if the V is deep enough, it's not that hard ;-)

#### Step 6: Scoop out the flesh

Use the razor sharp spoons you created in step 1.

#### Step 7: Enjoy!
