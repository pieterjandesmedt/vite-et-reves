summary: "We're saying a fond farewell to our dream crew Hannah and Antoine."
---

`From: Buccoo, Tobago`<br/>
`To: Charlotteville, Tobago`

If you ever need crew on your boat and Hannah and Antoine show up, don't hesitate. Actually, if you ever need people for anything and they show up, don't hesitate. Because Hannah and Antoine are the real deal. I have never met more helpful, positive, eager to learn, humble, funny, interesting, easy-going, patient and all-round good people. When we needed help sailing, they were ready. They took their watches without ever complaining, even when Antoine was really seasick the first few days. Come to think of it, they never complained about anything.

They saw work and did it without being asked --- especially cooking those delicious recipies and doing the dishes, we can't thank you enough for that. They proposed solutions when problems or situations arose. They were always helpful, from the day we met them. They taught us new things. They made our life easier and enriched it. The kids, too, loved them to bits.

Our ways separated in Buccoo. Some tears were shed. They will stay in a guesthouse for a few days and surf in a nearby bay, then travel southwards to Trinidad and go work in a surf camp in Costa Rica, with the long-term goal of creating a new life in New Zealand. We'll travel north to Charlotteville, to the other Caribbean islands and wherever the wind takes us.

Thank you, Hannah and Antoine, for voyaging 50 days with us. I hope we'll meet again someday. May all your dreams and the life you have envisioned for yourself come true!
