`From: Grand Anse Bay, Grenada`<br/>
`To: Woburn Bay, Grenada`

Grand Anse Bay is now a quarantine zone. More than 700 yachts are arriving in the coming weeks to escape possible hurricanes destroying the northern West-Indies. All of them have to stay in quarantine for 14 days. We had to move, so we sailed back to Woburn Bay.

Vite & Rêves is starting to resemble a caged lion, going in circles around Grenada. We left with a tail wind. After rounding Point Salines, that tail wind became a head wind. I turned on the engines and motored the rest of the way.

Visibility was good and the sun was high is the sky, so I decided to go carefully between the reefs instead of around. The sea is much calmer there. I kept an eye on the charts the whole time. It was a bit stressy when the depth decreased to 1.5 meters. With the daggers up, Vite & Rêves only draws 70 centimeters, but still a bit shallow for my liking. We made it without incident to Woburn Bay.
