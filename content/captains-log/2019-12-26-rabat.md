`At: Rabat, Morocco`

We spent one day in Bou Regreg marina in Rabat, or actually in its sister city, Salé. The Bou Regreg river separates Rabat from Salé. Bou Regreg marina is on the Salé side. The marina itself is new and really nice. The showers are without a doubt the best we've seen so far. And we've seen a lot. We consider ourselves _shower conoisseurs_ by now.

There used to be a ferry service from the marina to Rabat, but that zodiac is "in repair" --- read: "we're not doing that anymore". So we ambled around on the new Salé promenade.

A lot of people come here in the evening to walk, sit on the benches, watch the sunset, play guitar, eat something in one of the restaurants and generally have a good time. There's even a Belgian restaurant, unfortunately with Belgian prices too.

We had a simple dinner --- burgers and crepes --- in one of the riverside restaurants and strolled back to the boat. It struck me again how relaxed and cosmopolitan the promenade is. It contrasted starkly with the Rabat side with its traffic and bustle. We went back to the boat and the kids played with the dingy in the harbor until bedtime.

We wish we could've stayed a bit longer, visit the city, see the sights. But we want to be in a land that allows drinking alcohol for New Year's eve.
