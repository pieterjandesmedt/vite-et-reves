`At: Vlychada bay, Western Peloponnesos, Greece`

Vlychada bay is magnificent. About half a mile long and 300m wide, surrounded on three sides by steep mountains, with a half sand, half pebble beach, and most important for sailors: a sandy bottom.

The people on the shore turned out to be a few easy-going campers spending the night there. This beach is undiscovered by the masses and unspoilt. There is also a climbing area close by.

We spent the day here, went to the beach to read and play in the sand. We reanchored, more because good seamanship demanded it than because it was necessary. The wind shifts here 180 degrees in a day: land wind at night --- when we arrived --- and sea wind during the day, so our anchor chain did a similar 180 degree loop.

I love anchoring in a secluded bay with good holding much more than being in port. Ports are loud, crowded, full of people out to scratch your boat with their boat, or lift your anchor with their anchor. Hard, unmoving structures are everywhere around you. Secluded bays are quiet, peaceful, and generally much better for stress levels and sleep. The only things missing are fresh water and a big supermarket. You guessed it, fresh water and food are running low.
