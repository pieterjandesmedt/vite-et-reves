`At: Grand Anse Bay, Grenada`<br/>

We couldn't take this lockdown anymore. I had my weekly shopping outing, but Barbara and the kids haven't been off the boat for more than a month. Barbara was beset with a severe case of cabin fever.

Around sunset, we snuck off to the beach. Mira came with us, but the boys --- by now so used to their prison --- wanted to stay on the boat and listen to [some new stories](https://www.geluidshuisuitgeverij.com/binnenpret) on the iPad.

As soon as we hit land, Mira took off at top speed on the deserted beach. We let her. The beach had a definite post-apocalyptic feel to it. No one in sight. All hotels next to the beach are closed. The sand is being reclaimed by palm trees. It felt like a private piece of heaven after being cooped up for so long.

We walked the whole beach and back, some 3km, and went back to Vite & Rêves. Mental refreshment accomplished.
