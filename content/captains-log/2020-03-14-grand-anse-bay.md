`From: Saint George, Grenada`<br/>
`To: Grand Anse bay, Grenada`

The Parents decided to move out of the boat, spurred on by a series of unfortunate encounters between Vite & Rêves and my Dad's head that left him all but scalped. They moved to a hotel near Grand Anse Bay, so we parked the boat there too.

Not every day is hot and sunny in the Caribbean. Sometimes it's hot and rainy. I took the opportunity to clean Vite & Rêves' bottom a bit. We stayed on the boat and had a quiet day.

The rain makes for lush vegetation and beautiful rainbows, especially around sunset.

At night, we enjoyed a very apt board game of ['PANDEMIC'](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic). This great game teaches cooperation and long-term strategy, the very things you need to survive a pandemic. Just a tip if you're in lockdown these days.
