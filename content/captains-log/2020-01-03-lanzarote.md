`At: Rubicon Marina, Lanzarote, Canary Islands`

Finally a place with washing machines! After having to miss washing clothes for more than a month, Barbara was as happy as a kitten in a yarn shop. The dryers didn't really do much though, so I strung up some extra lines and we hung _all_ our clean laundry out to dry.

We went for a long walk along the coast to Papagayo beach. At first we encountered a watchtower for pirates, a lot of hotels and after a while only barren lava hills. We talked about volcanoes and lava a lot that day.

Papagayo beach is a long stretch of golden sand. As soon Mira set foot in the sand, she would not budge one more step. "I'm staying here to make sand castles", she declared and that was final.

The boys joined in the fun and were soon building a whole city in the sand.

We walked back around sunset and had a well-deserved pizza (pizzeria _7 sensi_, recommended).

Since being on volcanic islands had piqued the kids' interest, I had to read the Wikipedia page on the [Krakatau eruption of 1883](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa) as a bedtime story. The boys were suitably impressed by so much natural violence.
