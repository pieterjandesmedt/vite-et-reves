`At: Porto Di Sant' Antioco, Sardinia, Italy`

November. Atlantic storms follow one another at a breakneck pace, spilling over into the Mediterranean. We are waiting for a good weather window to cross over to Menorca. Yes, change of plans. We're not going to the south of France anymore. The pessimist complains about the wind, the optimist hopes it will change, the realist adjusts the sails _and the destination_.

We're not willing to battle 40 to 50 knot headwinds for probably weeks to get to France. So now we're waiting. And waiting. We do laundry. We go shopping. We get diesel. We make sure everything is ready. Tomorrow looks okay, wind-wise, to take the plunge.

This evening, we went for a last cocktail and a pizza. Then it's bye bye Italy, hello Spain!
