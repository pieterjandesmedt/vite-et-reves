`At: Woburn Bay, Grenada`

We got asked a few times already what our plans are now. As you know, the original plan was to sail to Australia and sell Vite & Rêves over there. But then Mother Nature released COVID19 and the overreaction of governments worldwide destroyed the dream. So it's not going to happen anymore. Or is it?

{{< image src="pexels-photo-839195.jpeg" alt="Is that the future I see?" ratio="16x9" >}}

The future is dark and unpredictable, but these are the options:

#### Sail back to Belgium

Taking the boat back to Europe is an option, although not something I would look forward to. It involves crossing the Atlantic in the 'wrong direction', having to actually mind the weather. It could be a beautiful experience though.

Pros|Cons
----|----
It's cheap | We should leave now
Easier to sell | Need crew
All our stuff comes with us | Hard on the boat
It's an experience | We could sail into a hurricane and die
We can still sail her in Belgium | Have to pay for berthing in Belgium
We can still live in it in Belgium |

#### Have Vite & Rêves shipped to Belgium

Another possibility is to put Vite & Rêves on a huge transport vessel and have her shipped to Belgium. But honestly, why would we do that?

Pros|Cons
----|----
Easier to sell | Costs a shipload of money (€20.000+ !)
We can still sail her in Belgium | Have to pay for berthing in Belgium
Safer than sailing home | Not sailing home is cheating
All our stuff comes with us |

#### Leave Vite & Rêves in Grenada

We could sail around here for a little longer, then put Vite & Rêves on the hard and sell her here. We fly back to Europe and somehow ship our stuff over too.

Pros|Cons
----|----
We can still live for cheap here | Leaving her on the hard costs a lot
We can still sail her here | We have to ship our stuff to Belgium

#### Sail on

Sailing on, maybe after a break of a few months, is an option for us, but the kids would rather not. Can I convince them in time?

Pros|Cons
----|----
Would make PJ & Barbara happy | Would make the kids unhappy
Would make the dream happen | Uncertain future regarding ease of traveling

So... what should we do? What would you do? Most sailing men we meet recoil wide-eyed in disbelief: "Don't go back to fucking _Belgium_, mate!" Most sailing women we meet are very understanding about missing friends and family.

<span class="email">Mail us</span> if you have related or other ideas. For the moment we're inclined to leaving and selling Vite & Rêves here in Grenada. If you want to buy [a magnificent Catana 401](/static/boat) to realize the dream for yourself, now is the time!
