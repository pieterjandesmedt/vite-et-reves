`At: Hog Island mangroves`

Well, Gonzalo kept surprising us. It arrived sooner than we expected (Friday night), then went completely south of Grenada (was expected to go slightly north), then died completely on Saturday.

We experienced a bit of the good ol' horizontal rain, but no more than 40 knots of wind (I think). Everyone was relieved and we had a good "we-survived-a-hurricane" drink at Roger's barefoot bar.

We exited the mangroves a few days afterwards and went back to our old, cool, mosquito-less spot next Hog Island bridge.
