`From: Ensenada de la Herradura, Spain`<br/>
`To: Marbella, Spain`

[Sinterklaas](https://www.stnicholascenter.org/around-the-world/customs/netherlands/sedaris) came! Kids must've been good this year. They were so excited that they got up at 5:45. Their animated whispering woke us. Barbara chased them back to bed. We'll have to add "Don't get up if it's still dark outside!" to the Boat Rules.

We left the nice and quiet Herradura cove for our second leg of the great push out of the Med.

When we came out of the cove, we encountered two sailboats battling their way upwind, to the west, tacking this way and that. "Tacking westward, that doesn't look very good," I thought. I wanted to join the battle, but the wind was just too light and the waves too high. It turned out they were just mucking around a bit, not really going anywhere.

But we had distance to cover! Places to be! I turned on the engines and we left them to play among themselves. I was hoping for better wind later. It never came. We had to motor all the way to Marbella. At least the big leftover swell from yesterday was still helping.
