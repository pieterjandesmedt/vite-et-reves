`At: Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy`

We provisioned again today, making good use of our guest Véronique and the kind of supermarkets you find in big cities. I even found razor blades, so I now look less like a Mexican drug lord. This will surely help when encountering [nightly Guardia Finanza patrols](/captains-log/2019-10-17-le-castella-bova-marina-the-perfect-sail).

Then we were off to explore Cagliari, mainly in search for ice-cream and pizza. The first pizzeria we encountered did not make the grade. I would presume a floating pizzeria in one of Italy's main harbors is a viable business idea, but the free market has decided otherwise.

I promised Mira we'd take the bus today, so we did. The kids were still fresh when we arrived at the foot of the old town, so they climbed all the way to the top. Véronique scouted the area the day before and she guided us around.

Climbing up the mountain, we had to dodge crazy Italian drivers hurtling themselves down the narrow streets with total contempt for death --- their own and other's. Sparks flying from their rear-view mirrors, these cars came skidding around blind corners without warning. We had barely enough time to grab the nearest kid and throw them into a doorway, hoping that the other adults could also save at least one kid.

If an Italian official ever reads this: stop allowing cars in your old city centers. They're not designed for cars. They're designed for people.

A bit jumpy, we reached the huge plaza at the top. It was full of surviving kids busy trying to kill each other with non-motorized vehicles.

The view over the harbor was nice though. Sometimes you can see pink flamboyances of flamingos from here, but we didn't spot any. They probably migrated for winter.

In the end, we found a gelateria, a cocktail bar and a very good pizzeria ("Madriga"). Completely stuffed, we took the bus back and rolled ourselves aboard Vite & Rêves.
