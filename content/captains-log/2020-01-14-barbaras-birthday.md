summary: "The Vite & Rêves crew celebrate Barbara's birthday with a veritable sailing village of Dutch sailors."
---

`At: Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands`

The last few days we have met a lot of people, mainly Dutch, who are sailing the same route as we. Some of the boats also have kids on board. Wings has two girls, ages 7 and 9, Blue Scarlet has two boys, ages 9 and 11. Toon and Marij of Pien made a little stowaway during the journey and their little baby daughter is now almost 1.

Aemelie of Wings --- sailors don't have last names, only boat names --- contacted me on [noforeignland.com](https://www.noforeignland.com/boat/5696081327292416) and invited us to their boat in the bay. Wings was the social hub of the evening. No less than 5 boats were present: Taroa, Calypso, Blue Scarlet, Vite & Rêves plus Wings itself. It was very _'gezellig'_, sitting on each other's laps. Kids were everywhere, crawling in and out of the hatches or going for a dingy ride in the bay.

We had a lovely evening and invited the kid families back to our boat for Barbara's birthday --- we forgot to get the other boats' contact details. Still a bit hungover from the evening before, when we had a pre-celebration with Hannah and Antoine, we nevertheless had a great time again.
