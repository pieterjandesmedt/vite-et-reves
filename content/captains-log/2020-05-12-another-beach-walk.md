`At: Grand Anse Bay, Grenada`<br/>

Our [last escape to the beach](/captains-log/2020-05-08-escape-to-the-beach) was so enjoyable that we decided to go again. This time we took the boys along as well.

We encountered a few other living souls. Everybody was super friendly but the post-apocalyptic vibe remained.
