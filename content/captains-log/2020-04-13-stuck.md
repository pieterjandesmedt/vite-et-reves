summary: "The Vite & Rêves crew make the best of the lockdown in Grenada."

`At: Woburn Bay, Grenada`

Don't worry about us, friends! We're doing fine, during these _interesting_ times.

There are currently 13 known covid19 cases on Grenada --- one positive case has fled to the UK --- and they are all locked up in quarantine, with their families. The government has overreacted a bit with the lockdown measures and now they seem unsure about how to untighten the reins again. 

It's just a bit boring here, because we can't get off the boat, except for groceries on certain days. On the other hand, it is 30ºC here every day, sunny, and the sea is nice and warm. T-shirt weather day and night. We read a lot, swim, follow the local news a bit. The world news is too anecdotal, chaotic and irrelevant to learn anything from --- but then again, it always was, wasn't it?

I practice a bit of piano, the kids have fun with Lego, Playmobil, little cars, [listening to stories](https://www.geluidshuisuitgeverij.com/binnenpret). They read and draw. The view and the sunsets are unbeatable.

We keep in touch with Immigration. The police and the coast guard do their work without making it difficult for us. The Ministry of Health officials are also easily accessible via facebook. They actually listen to ideas that people have, sometimes implemented the same week. There are benefits to living in a country of 120,000 inhabitants.

We also get more and more in touch with the other cruisers that are stuck here. They all seem to converge on this side of the island. Everyone helps one another as much as possible, especially by exchanging practical information, like: Where can I find fresh fruit and vegetables? Answer: At the farm, straight from the field, twenty minutes walk.

The locals take it fairly laconically and remain friendly and helpful. Everyone wears a mouth mask, or nose mask, or chin mask, or forehead mask. The masks are more of a 'I'm cooperating' signal than something that [works effectively](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/well/live/coronavirus-face-mask-mistakes.html).

We're looking forward to the moment when the neighboring islands open their borders again so we can finish another small part of our journey. Being able to have a beer at a bar or eating out at a restaurant would be nice too.
