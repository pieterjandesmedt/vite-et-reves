`At: Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands`

After a quiet day and a quiet night in the bay, we wanted to check what was up with the marina waiting list. I took the boys with me in the dingy to the marina office. We arrived at 15:50. Siesta. Of course. We're back in Spain after all. We waited patiently for 10 minutes. When my phone said 16:00, I went in.

> "Sir! We are _closed_! The office opens at 16:00!"

I checked my phone. 16:01. I looked at their clock on the wall. 15:50. With much eye-rolling and hand-waving they acquiesced. I closed the door.

> "No sir, leave the door open. Our siesta is ruined now anyway."

I explained we arrived the day before and were waiting in the bay, and if there was maybe room in the marina today? I needed to get the rigging checked and do some repairs.

> "Did you write down the name of your boat?"

> "Erm... no. I thought I saw your marineros write down our name when they sent me away yesterday morning."

> "Please add your boat to the waiting list. There are 20 boats before you."

> "Ok, but I only want to stay a couple of days."

The guy looked at Andreas and Helder, who used their most convincing puppy eyes.

> "Oh, only a couple of days, why didn't you say so? We have room for you for a couple of days."

How these people are still in business I will never know.

> "Have you paid yet for the days that you anchored here?"

> "Wait, what? You don't let people in and then let them pay for anchoring _outside_ your marina?"

> "Well, yes."

Now I know how they are still in business. On the way out I overheard someone saying he had been waiting in the bay for a week. Easy money.

I brought Vite & Rêves to the reception pier and went in again. I spent more than an hour in what must be the slowest check-in to this day. Morocco was lighting fast compared to these guys. In the end they informed me that they had no room in the marina. I needed to go to the marina next door.
