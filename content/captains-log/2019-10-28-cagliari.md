`To: Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy`

We left the tranquil bay of Villasimius in the morning, excited to meet up with Véronique. A pity we couldn't stay longer, it was so nice and the whole bay scented of rosemary and pine trees.

We had to motor another 4 hours straight into the wind to get to Cagliari. I tried sailing but the wind was too weak to get us anywhere in reasonable time. I resigned myself. We cleaned up the boat a bit. We passed several tower ruins built on top of the hills. Most of them look like Super Mario World characters.

We arrived in the huge, industrial port of Cagliari. The port makes Cagliari one of the richest cities in the country, on par with the north of Italy. It has that kind of big city vibe around it. I never saw so many people do sports in an Italian city. Fancy sports too, like waterpolo and rowing.

In the evening we took a walk to the city center to find a place to eat. We encountered multitudes of joggers and bikers along the way. People looked genuinely surprised we were not doing any sports. Giving in to peer pressure, we started doing little races with the kids. The Cagliarians nodded approvingly. The kids slept very well that night.
