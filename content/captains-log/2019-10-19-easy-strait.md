`From: Bova Marina, Italy`<br/>
`To: Archi, Italy`

Yesterday we did some swimming and provisioning. Not much to report. The grib files predicted more wind for today, but that wind did not really materialize. We left anyway on a glassy sea. Our diesel tanks had only one-fifth left, so we couldn't spend a lot of time motoring.
With the Code D up, Vite & Rêves was able to coax 2 knots of boat speed out of 3 knots of wind.

We passed a factory with a _huge_ chimney. Someone was compensating --- possibly for the mountains behind the factory --- when they designed this.

Cape Riace looked like something out of a Märklin diorama.

When we entered the strait of Messina, I changed the Code D for the spinnaker. Very light puffs of air pushed us slowly forward. Around sunset, the wind increased gradually until the perfect 10 knots. Tall ship 'Sea Cloud' passed us on engine. Too bad, the wind came from the perfect direction for such a ship.

After dark, we found diesel in the harbor of Reggio Calabria. We asked how much it would cost to stay a night. € 60. This is something that shocked me about Italy, compared to Greece. In Greece, staying in a harbor is usually cheap (around €10), and most of the time it's even free. In Italy, I thought the great marina of Santa Maria Di Leuca was expensive (€ 19 per night). But it's becoming more expensive the more westward we go.

Luckily, anchoring out is free and we both prefer it to docking in a marina. We found a quiet, semi-protected bay that would serve us nicely through the night.
