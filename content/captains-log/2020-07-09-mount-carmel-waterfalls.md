`At: Mount Carmel, Grenada`

Finally we're able to visit things on land again! We hired a taxibus with some friends and piled the 18 of us into it. We were going to see some waterfalls today! The initial plan was to visit the Seven Sisters falls.

We drove into the mountains, into the rainforest. Close to our destination, it started bucketing down. We couldn't see more than 20 meters in front of us. The roads became waterfalls themselves. We could've taken the dinghy to our destination. Our ride started sliding going around corners.

At one point, the minibus couldn't make the steep grade. We all had to get out and help push. Then the door fell off. All part of the adventure.

We decided not to go to Seven Sisters. Getting there would also entail a half hour hike through now very muddy mountainous terrain. There was another waterfall, the Mount Carmel falls, not too far away, on the sunny side of the island. We decided to go there. Best decision of the day.

We walked about 10 minutes over a gently sloping path. Still muddy, but not deadly.

The Mount Carmel waterfall is in a tranquil, manicured part of the jungle. We met maybe 12 other people during the whole day. We went swimming, had a picknick and an all around good time.
