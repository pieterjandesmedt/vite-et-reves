`From: Lavrion Olympic Marine, Greece`<br/>
`To: Lavrion Port, Greece`

We wanted to be closer to the Lavrion shops and restaurants, so we moved Vite & Rêves to the town port. We could stay the night at the quay on the mooring berths of Perfect Yachts. Friendly guys. We first grabbed a bite.

While the Parents entertained our kids and went shopping, we rented a car to drive to Ikea near the Athens airport. Some €430 euros lighter (damn you Ikea, we just wanted some blankets!) we got back after dark.

I moved the boat a bit closer to the quay after mother had a panic attack trying to cross the gangway.
