What day is this? What month? Still 2020? At least still 2020, of that I'm quite sure. The days merge into one another like they have never done before.

speed of light = speed of causality

some things are causal, some things not e.g. quantum things like radioactive decay
some things == big things? i.e. many things together?
is causality a superposition of non-causality?
do non-causal things have a speed limit?
if not, how does the speed of causality get 'generated' by superposition of many non-causal things?
is there something like a probability field?
what is the relationship between causality and time?
is time real or an illusion?
time vs entropy?
the map is not the territory - the model is not the thing
does it have anything to do with quantum fluctuations? (re entropy and non-causality)
are non-causal things simply in different lightcones?
what causes locality?
