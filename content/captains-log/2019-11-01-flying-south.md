`From: Nora, Sardinia, Italy`<br/>
`To: Porto Teulada, Sardinia, Italy`

We left Nora in very little wind. I was hoping it would increase a little along the way. I must have hoped too intensely.

We mounted the {{% explain "gennaker" "a large light sail that is used when the wind comes _from the side_ of your boat" %}} and for a while, the sailing was perfect. Flat seas and 12 knots. I said to Véronique: "Enjoy this while it lasts, usually about 5 minutes."

A stunt plane flew by, did a tour around the boat. It flew so close we could clearly see the pilot. We waved and he gave a little wave back, before flying back to land and disappearing between the mountains. I think my next project will be learning to fly.

When we neared cape Spartivento, the wind did a predictable but still surprising 120 degree shift. We rolled in the gennaker just in time. The wind increased to 22 knots, Vite & Rêves sped up to 9 knots. The waves became a lot higher when we flew past the cape. Véronique got a taste of open sea sailing.

We sailed about 45 degrees off the wind, with the daggerboards halfway down. The wind now strengthened to the low 30's. With one {{% explain "reef" "make the sail smaller by rolling it in or lowering it a bit" %}} in the main, and sometimes one in the genua too, the ride remained comfortable, even with the large waves.

After 3 tacks --- I still underestimate the angle we can make in higher seas --- we arrived in the protected bay near Porto Teulada. During one of the tacks, we didn't roll in the genua enough. The sail flapped so violently that it knocked the deck light loose. Fortunately, the loose pieces fell on the deck and Barbara was fast enough to catch both of them. I climbed the mast to fix it. Nothing permanently broken and the light still works. Quality stuff!
