`At: Grand Anse Bay, Grenada`


"_A [green flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_flash) is an elusive meteorological optical phenomenon that sometimes occurs transiently around the moment of sunset or sunrise. When the conditions are right, a distinct green spot is briefly visible above the upper rim of the Sun's disk. The green appearance usually lasts for no more than two seconds._"

I was trying to get one on camera and last night, I got one! A small one, but definitely green.

_Sigh_. Another day in lockdown...
