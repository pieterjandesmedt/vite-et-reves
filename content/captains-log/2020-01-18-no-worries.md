`From: Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands`<br/>
`To: Cabo Verde`

PSA: Don't worry about the lack of posts lately, dear reader! We had a _lot_ of boat jobs to do in Las Palmas, socialized with a veritable sailing village of Dutch people doing the same route, celebrated Barbara's birthday, etc. etc.

We're out of internet data because of a slight miscalculation at our arrival in the Canary Islands, which means no photo uploads for the moment.

We're starting our journey to Cabo Verde today. We hope to arrive in a bit less than a week, so no updates until then.

See you next week!

_EDIT: We arrived safely in Mindelo on SÃ£o Vicente! More details about the passage will follow soon!_
