`From: Island Elafonisos, Southern Peloponnesos, Greece`<br/>
`To: Geralimena, Southern Peloponnesos, Greece`

The morning promised a nice sailing day. 15 knots from the north, we needed to go west. Perfect. After a few hours --- yes, it still takes us some time to get started in the morning --- the wind had increased to 22 knots. Ok, it would be more 'exciting' than just 'nice' sailing today then. All the same for me. Barbara had a slightly worried look on her face.

I put a reef in the main and off we went! Vite & Rêves, always eager to be sailing, accelerated straight to 9 knots. We almost had a collective whiplash. We went as fast as the waves, which makes for a very comfortable ride.

Later in the day, the wind decreased slowly and turned to the south, luckily via east, not via west, where we are going. During few hours, we could go wing on wing, which in a monohull is always slightly disquieting because the possibility of a broach or chinese gibe. On Vite & Rêves, with her double main sheet system, there is nothing to worry about. I took a nap on the trampolines.

We passed cape Tainaron, the middle finger of the Peloponnesos hand.

The wind died a very slow death. The last hour we motored again to the unexpectedly lovely town of Geralimena, perched between a cliff (that is strikingly lighted at night) and a gigantic mountain.

Andreas would like to make a public announcement that everyone is very safe on the boat, even the cuddly toys.
