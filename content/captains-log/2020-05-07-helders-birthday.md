`At: Grand Anse Bay`

Helder turned 7 today! We celebrated with balloons, presents, pancakes and brownies.

This is probably the last birthday we'll celebrate on the boat. Our kids had their birthdays on different sides of the Atlantic: Mira in Morocco, Andreas in the middle of the Ocean, and Helder in Grenada. There's a nice symmetry to that.
