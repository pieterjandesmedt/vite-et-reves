summary: "We sail south again on the windward side of the island"

`From: Sauteurs, Grenada`<br/>
`To: Woburn Bay, Grenada`

If everything in the world is going south, then why wouldn't we? We left Sauteurs after being anchored there for another day. We thought about doing some shopping, but the grocery days changed this week (they change every week). Communication is not the government's strongest suit.

We took the windward side of the island. As this is the Atlantic Ocean side, the waves are a bit higher than on the Caribbean Sea side. We started in 20-25 knot winds, so I put one reef in the main. We sailed first to the north-east past London Bridge, an then southwards win the wind on the beam.

The tide was going out, so around London Bridge the currents were going against the wind, which made for steep, confused waves. Vite & RÃªves handled them, but it was quite rough at times. Luckily the two currents were no more than a mile wide and after that we were in calmer water for the rest of the trip. Mira had promptly fallen asleep as protection against seasickness

We passed many uninhabited islands along the way. They would be excellent for self-isolation in this troubled times. And they all have cool piraty names.

After a pleasant half day of sailing, we arrived in Woburn Bay. We made a full circle around the island. We threw our anchor and it took hold for the first time. Some sailing days are perfect.
