`At: Hog Island, Grenada`

Just like that, suddenly, unexpectedly, we found what we've been looking for.

We spent a few delightful afternoons on Hog Island, drinking ice cold beers in Roger's barefoot beach bar. A favorite hangout for locals and cruisers alike.

Other liveaboards in the bay drop by, kids play on the beach and in the woods making fast friends, old salts regale us with their tales of circumnavigations, sailing adventures and misadventures.

Living the life!
