`At: Lavrion Olympic Marine`

We're getting ready to leave for our world trip. We took 5 small suitcases and 2 big ones of clothes and stuff, 3 kids and 2 Parents with us to start. The Parents will travel back at the end of the week. They're getting us started, getting supplies and helping with the kids.

We also met with my brother and his father-in-law Vassilis, who just got back from climbing Mount Olympos. He said it reminded him a bit of Istiklal street in Istambul, full of big broken stones and old people walking very slowly.

Giorgos, Vassilis' brother-in-law, also made a guest appearance and helped us a lot with the groceries. After our shake-down cruise in August, when we ran permanently out of water, I elected to buy 60 bottles of water. Just to be sure. The axles of Giorgos' car were complaining only moderately.
