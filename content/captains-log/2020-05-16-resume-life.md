summary: "Grenada beaches are open again! Finally!"

`At: Grand Anse Bay, Grenada`

Living space on Vite & RÃªves is about 30m<sup>2</sup>. This works out to about 6m<sup>2</sup> per person. Imagine living on 2 by 3 m for more than a month. The United Nations has condemned countries for less. Amnesty International would write some _very_ angry letters.

To put things in perspective: out of 120 000 inhabitants, 7 currently have covid19. All are quarantined and doing well. Contact tracing is continuous and extensive. In short: There's zero risk.

As of last Monday, businesses are carefully opening again. Restaurants and bars are still closed, but the rest is back to normal. Every day is a grocery day, so the lines at the supermarkets have disappeared.

And the best thing: the beaches are open again. Only from 5:00 to 11:00 in the morning, but still, it's a good start. A sign that things are slowly going back to normal.

We hopped in the dinghy faster than you could say _"Land ho"_ and delighted in an early beach visit.
