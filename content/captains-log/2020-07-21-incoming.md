`At: Hog Island, Grenada`

The National Hurricane Center is [warning us](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&fdays=5) about showers and thunderstorms that _'continue to get better organized'_. Perhaps they're forming a union and a facebook group, as well as a tropical depression. In any case, they appear to be up to no good.

Before they're starting making trouble in the neighborhood, we need to get our act together as well. Next steps: Clearing Vite & Rêves' bottom ecosystem, getting some diesel in the tanks, and seeking the advice of experienced cruisers. Wish us luck!
