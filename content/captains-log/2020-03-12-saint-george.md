`From: Le Phare Blue Marina, Grenada`<br/>
`To: Saint George, Grenada`

The Parents are visiting us once more! They arrived just before the whole world got into Covid19 lockdown mode, completing a reckless and daring journey through the challenging Madrid and Miami airports, battling infected Spaniards and Americans, wielding nothing more than an umbrella and a hefty book (or so I imagine).

We spent a few days together in Le Phare Blue, enjoying the marina pool, before setting sail to Saint George.

Once we sailed past Glover Island, the sea became flat and the wind kept a blowing at nice 15 knots. Perfect sailing conditions!

We turned north and sailed {{% explain "close-hauled" "sailing with the wind coming from almost the front of the boat" %}}, with the daggerboards fully down, into the Saint George lagoon. A rainbow over the town welcomed us.

We elected to spend two nights in the Port Louis marina, the only superyacht marina in Grenada, hobnobbing with the likes of Barry Diller and Diane von Fürstenberg on [Eos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eos_(yacht)) --- okay, we saw the ship from a distance.

A superyacht marina has superyacht prices, and although the showers are great, we're not staying longer than we have to.
