`To: Nora, Sardinia, Italy`

Today we left Cagliari. The wind was very good to start with: 10 knots on the beam. Another Belgian sailboat was leaving the harbor just before us. Racing time! I'm not very competitive --- unless I'm sure I'm going to win. I lost no time getting our sails up, then darted forward to hoist the Code D, increasing our speed even more. We left them eating our bubbles.

The wind was coming from behind us a little while. We exchanged the Code D for the spinnaker and dropped the main. After half an hour, without warning, the wind shifted 180 degrees, now coming from straight in front of us. I groaned, we furled the spi, shifted our course, and tried to make the best of it. Close-hauled sailing the rest of the way. The wind kept turning slowly, so every ten minutes I could shave 3 degrees of the course, bringing us slightly closer to our destination.

About two hours before sunset we tacked and headed to the shore. I decided to anchor in Nora bay. It looked protected.

We arrived after nightfall in Nora bay. It seems that there's an archeological site nearby, but we couldn't make it out in the darkness.
