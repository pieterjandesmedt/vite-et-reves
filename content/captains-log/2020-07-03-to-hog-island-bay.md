`From: Woburn Bay, Grenada`<br/>
`To: Hog Island Bay, Grenada`

[Guus](https://www.facebook.com/mycat.yemanja), a fellow Belgian and world traveller we met one night on Hog Island beach, is leaving today. He said: "You should take my place, it's a good one. I'm leaving at sunrise."

We woke up exceptionally early at 7:30, drank a coffee and were on our way. It was a short tour around Hog Island, threading carefully through the reefs instead of going around them to sea.

Hog Island bay is much less windy and less rolly than Woburn Bay. The water is so calm it's like a marina. No wonder it's not easy to get a spot here!

Added bonus: we're closer to the beach and to our friends!
